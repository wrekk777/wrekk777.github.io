    <strong>Rougemont Water Project</strong><br/>
    This is a project I worked on early in my career. At the time I became involved, the county was attempting to bring a water line down from the city to the north. This was very expensive because of the length of the main and all of the rock in the ground in northern Durham County. Look at the innovative solution we found for this community. <br/>
