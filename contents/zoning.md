*Zoning and Land Use in the U.S.: History, Theory, and Regional Variation*

This independent study explores the structure, function, and variation of land use regulation in the United States, with a primary focus on zoning. The course examines how zoning has historically operated as a tool of spatial and social governance, and how regulatory outcomes are shaped by not only ideology and party control but also procedural rules, institutional design, and organized interests. Through a combination of theoretical texts and empirical research, the student will analyze the evolution of zoning practices, evaluate regional variation, and begin preliminary data exploration using land use regulation indices and policy datasets. The course also prepares the groundwork for dissertation research on the intersection of zoning, political institutions, and housing policy.
