In addition to my full-time work in local government, I occasionally take on consulting projects under the name Wayfarer Associates. The name reflects my approach—I don’t lead or direct, but rather walk alongside organizations and communities, helping them navigate from one place to another. My role is to assist in reading the signs and terrain, helping clients reach their goals more efficiently.


I specialize in strategic planning, funding identification, grant writing, and grants management. While my availability has been extremely limited over the past year, I’m always open to a conversation. If I’m unable to assist directly, I’m happy to connect you with colleagues in my network.


To maintain transparency and avoid conflicts of interest, I do not take on engagements within Mecklenburg County, NC, or with organizations based in the area.
